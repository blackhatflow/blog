### Better cloaking :

- we now have 3 protection layers. Blackflow chained with both Leadcloak and Traffic armor. The reason is that their IP database is slightly different, and combining them assure that we just get the best cloaking ever.
  
  It's an extra step for us, but we know it means a lot to you, if your account can run longer and spend more.

- cutting edge cloaking method: On top of that, we now offers new options with reverse proxy ( fully mirroring exernal website ), curl, and redirection ( yes it's actually works better than shopify / github on facebook lately )

### Better tracking:

previously we relied entierly on tracking users client side ( with js ), but we realize that depending of the device, we were missing some of your traffic. So now we also track server side for 100% accuracy ( same as other trackers but with the benefit of no redirection ). We won't miss any visits or click! 

### Better useability

we are always working on making blackflow simpler and easier to use. Whats noticeable lately is the stats, new layout and viewing user behavior got easier
