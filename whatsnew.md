## What's new - 14 January 2020

#### Better cloaking 🛡

- we now have 3 protection layers. Blackflow chained with both **Leadcloak and Traffic armor**. The reason is that their IP database is slightly different, and combining them assure that we just get the best cloaking ever.
  
  It's an extra step for us, but we know it means a lot to you, if your account can run longer and spend more.

- cutting edge cloaking method: We now have **reverse proxy**(  fully mirroring an exernal website to use it as safe page ), curl, and redirection ( and lately, it's actually works better than shopify on facebook! )

#### Better tracking 🔗

Tracking just got more accurate! Previously we tracked users client side using js, we realized that on some device we couldn't track up to 10% of your traffic. Now **we also track server side** for 100% accuracy ( same as other trackers but with the benefit of no redirection ). We won't miss any visits or click!
