## Smarter funnel

Most affiliates promoting crypto are not matching the offer image on the lander. Instead they are using outdated image, even in the WRONG country currency!

Other vertical like nutra or sweeptakes have since a long time optimized their lander to match the country or ISP.

So blackflow funnel got smarter for crypto too: the step1, step2, step3 images on the lander now match dynamically the offer. 

The benefit is that it's more congruent, so more certainty for the user, so more FTDs!

**Example for UK**: We show UK flag, GBP currency, and english language. ( Again this is obvious but most affiliate are not doing it as it extra work to update it )

## What's new - 14 January 2020

Summing things up: cloaking and tracking improvment, better UI and some nice tools to make blackflow easier.

#### 1) Better cloaking ðŸ›¡

- we now have 3 protection layers. Blackflow chained with both **Leadcloak and Traffic armor**. The reason is that what they check and their IPs database is slightly different, and combining them assure that we just get the best cloaking ever.
  
  It's an extra step for us, but we know it means a lot to you, if your account can run longer and spend more.

- cutting edge cloaking method: We now have **reverse proxy**(  fully mirroring an exernal website to use it as safe page ), curl, and redirection ( and lately, it's actually works better than shopify on facebook! )

<br>

#### 2) More accurate tracking ðŸ”—

Tracking just got more accurate! Previously we tracked users client side using js, we realized that on some device we couldn't track up to 10% of your traffic. Now **we also track server side** for 100% accuracy ( same as other trackers but with the benefit of no redirection ). We won't miss any visits or click! 

<br><br>

#### 3) Even Easier ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›

We are always working on making blackflow easier to use.
