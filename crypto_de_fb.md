1. make your [campaign link](#campaign) on blackflow

2. then set a [safe page](#lander), 

3. then [build the ad](#ad) on fb

4. using the [pixel](#pixel)

## Intro

So facebook is beast on his own. Things changed a lot, you can't expect to launch dirty ads, get it live and even make any money on it.



My background is facebook arbitrage ( 2 years, 1 million in spend  ) so i've been playing with low cpc and pixel a lot, so in my view this is the key. Every settings you add in term of interest and audience raise your CPC. So the stragegy i recommend is settings up broad targeting and let the pixel do the work. 


By broad targeting, i mean to not select any interest, just keep it to the country/device and maybe gender/age that you want. What i do is DE/AU/CH + desktop + newsfeed/ sidebar + male 35+ . Again feel free to try anything, i just recommend to keep it broad. ( yes result will be bad at the beginning )



Then for the angle you usually get to choose between two options : Indirect ( celebrity ect.. ) or direct ( trading, makes money )

It's up to you to be creative and to be subbtle enough to suggest your audience this is going to be a "hack to make quick money easily"



So targeting, angle, now about the pixel : 

When you launch on a new account, you set up a new pixel and you have no data yet. So you need to create a Traffic campaign first to get some data ( that will be bad ). Keep your angle safe, no need to be agressive here, it's good for a warming up.

I don't recommend warming up on other domain / page like, but everyone his stragegy. 

Run a a bit of traffic budget 20$ and turn on the campaign on blackflow after a day or two to get some data. 
Then as we get some data, create custom conversion. We need to see a least a time120s, time 180s and lead to start with.

So we get of time120 events quite quickly ( which mean people are staying on the page at least 2min ) and we can use that to make a new campaign set on Conv with adset on time 120s ( custom conversion that we previously created ). As you get more and more data, spending 100$$ ( result will be just OK at this point ), you can start to make adset that target Leads ( our second custom conversion we created )

As you let facebook optimize, keep a low budget 50-100$ and you will see your cost per conv drop over the next fews days.
Don't forget to check comments on your ads if you were targeting on news feed ( user can't comment on sidebar ads )

What to do if your account get banned ? 

First step is to archive the campaign so it return a blank page instead, then appeal.
