# Guide to cloaking

*Blackflow take care of the cloaking and integration, but in some case you need to choose the cloaking method yourself, as it depends on your angle. Just ask us if you have doubt.*

## How to choose a cloaking method

#### Blackflow currently have 5 options for the safe page

- **redirect**: redirect to any page like amazon, ebay etc.. 

- **curl**: host any external page ( but it's not a mirror - if you click links on the page it will go to original site ) 

- **reverse proxy**: fully mirror an external site, we only support a few domain ( etsy, usatoday, euronews etc.. )

- **WP website**: arbitrage website with wordpress, top 10 article, next button and display ads

- **include**: best scenario where we host a custom lander

| method            | same domain | zero -redirect | full website                            |
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| **redirect**      | no          | no             | ✔                                       |
| **curl**          | ✔           | ✔              | yes but click links go to original site |
| **reverse proxy** | ✔           | ✔              | ✔no domain authority                    |
| **WP website**    | ✔           | ✔              | ✔ no domain authority                   |
| **include**       | ✔           | ✔              | no ( just a lander)                     |

======

The choice of the methods depends of your **angle** and of the **traffic source.**

#### **<u>here are our current observations</u>**

**facebook** ( Recommendation : Redirect )

*Facebook usually require a full website with terms and quality content, so **include** is usually not an option, and **wordpress website** are seeing lot of disapproval lately.*

| Rank | Method        | Chance of approval | Spending |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 1    | **redirect**  | 9                  | 6        |
| 2    | reverse proxy | 8                  | ?        |
| 3    | curl          | 7                  | ?        |
| 4    | WP            | 3                  | ?        |

**google** ( Recommendation : WP website )

*Google don't allow any redirect*

| Rank | Method        | Chance of approval | Spending |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 1    | WP website    | 9                  | 8        |
| 2    | reverse proxy | 7                  | 7        |
| 3    | curl          | ?                  | ?        |

**native** ( Recommendation : curl  / reverse proxy )

| Rank | Method        | Chance of approval | Spending |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 1    | WP website    | 8                  | 10       |
| 2    | reverse proxy | 8                  | 10       |
| 3    | curl          | 8                  | 8        |

## How to use it

let's go over the methods and how to use it

### Content website

Attached to your domain is a content website ( WP ) with random article. It look similar to an arbitrage website as we show a NEXT button and display ads on the sidebar.

This is a good option for source that tolerate arbitrage ( taboola, revcontent etc ... not so much for facebook anymore)

it allow you to choose safe page with an article close to your angle

Let's try it.

Lander > Filter by integration

For example for crypto IT, we have loaded articles about* 'top works to do from home*' or '*richest people*' or *'investments tips*' . The point is that it's **congruent** to any angle you can think off for your ad. ( Congruent = it will make sense when the source check your funnel ). If you need article we don't have yet, just ask us.

### Redirect

*Redirect simply redirect to another website. Some source don't allow it likes google, facebook is fine with it lately, and native source can't really ban it as there is still many agency using a tracking link.*

Here is a very simple ( and plain stupid ) example with amazon.

Let's go on amazon.com ( or amazon.it, .de, .fr etc.. ) and pick any product that you think make sense for your ad.

The way to use is very simple. Just add the path of the safe page to your campaign link.

To explain step by step:

- Get the URL

```
https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Bitcoin/dp/B00XVJ3OB4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bitcoin+rise&qid=1576004004&sr=8-1
```

- remove the query part ( after "?" ) and only keep the path:

```
Rise-Bitcoin/dp/B00XVJ3OB4/
```

- No just add the path in your campaign link ( after the **.com** and before the **?**)

```html
https://dailable.com/<b>Rise-Bitcoin/dp/B00XVJ3OB4/<b/>?source=facebook&campaign=094545a1&cid={{campaign.name}}&sid={{adset.name}}&aid={{ad.name}}
```

- Lastly, add in the safe page parameter, which domain we should redirect to. Here we need amazon.it, the ID is 304, so i will add **s=304**

```
https://dailable.com/Rise-Bitcoin/dp/B00XVJ3OB4/?source=facebook&campaign=094545a1&cid={{campaign.name}}&sid={{adset.name}}&aid={{ad.name}}&s=304
```

And unlike other tracker or cloaker, the redirection is blazing fast ( 135 ms )

### CURL

======

with curl method, you can host any external page.

**Example**

1) Choose any page you like. 

https://www.consigli.it/massimo-boldi-e-christian-de-sica-i-film-imperdibili-della-coppia/

2) Load it to blackflow

![2020-01-17 16.32.24.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackhatflow/storage/master/2020/01/17-16-32-49-2020-01-17%2016.32.24.gif)

3) Find the ID of the lander you added ( 321 ) and use in safe page parameter **s=321**

### Reverse proxy

Reverse proxy is **same as curl but in better** , as we create a mirror of the website on our domain. ( We have to build it first so if you find a site you want to clone, just tell us. )

With is method, you don't need to load the lander in our system. You can choose any page of the site.

**For example**

Site we want to clone : [https://www.livemomentous.com/](https://www.livemomentous.com/) This website would work well as safe page for nutra health)

On our domain : [https://www.ifadlabs.com/](https://www.ifadlabs.com/)

Then same method as the redirect, you choose any path and copy it's path

```
https://livemomentous.com/products/absolutezero-plant?variant=8097396621410

only keep the path : 

products/absolutezero-plant

add the path to your campaign link : 

https://ifadlabs.com/?variant=8097396621410&campaign=094545a1

===> 

https://ifadlabs.com/products/absolutezero-plant?variant=8097396621410&campaign=094545a1
```

add the s=300 which is the ID from the lander proxy

```
https://ifadlabs.com/products/absolutezero-plant/?campaign=094545a1&s=300
```

*Note: i removed above the tracking for the explanation, but don't forget to add it*

<u>Our final campaign link for facebook : </u>

```
https://ifadlabs.com/products/absolutezero-plant/?source=facebook&campaign=094545a1&cid={{campaign.name}}&sid={{adset.name}}&aid={{ad.name}}&s=300
```

### Include
