#### gclid

Very important: you need to activate google auto tagging, the gclid, because 1) if not  your traffic will be filtered and 2) you can use it for pixel

## optimize



## tips

cap your cpc, otherwise can go really high. ideally cpc is below 0.6$

schedule your campaign between 8am-8pm local time on weekdays, as it convert less as night ( call center are close and won't call your leads ), and convert less on weekend.
