**TIPS**

- what would be your strategy about it
  
  > Probably find some highly relevant pages to the ad. Then target only those pages setting 'Placements' to 'Target'. Start with CPM bidding then change to maximise clicks then change to CPA. Once it's as CPA enable 'Conservative' targeting and let Google learn outside of those placements. But I'm not sure this will work with Blackhat because it might need a lot of spend to get 50 conversions in crypto.

- how to lower cpc for campaign with small scale
  
  > You can find placements, even specific URLs, with low CPC and target only those with a 'Maximise Clicks' and set a max. CPC. Usually they'll be pages that are very relevant to your ad.

- do you see adwords or display working better for it?
  
  > Both are good but search is more expensive. Quality on search is better for me. On search you have to get a high QS which would mean your safe page needs to add value and be relevant. Search partners have a lot of potential so make sure they're enabled.
