## What's new - 14 January 2020



Summing things up: cloaking and tracking improvment, better UI and some nice tools to make blackflow easier.



#### 1) Better cloaking ðŸ›¡

- we now have 3 protection layers. Blackflow chained with both **Leadcloak and Traffic armor**. The reason is that what they check and their IPs database is slightly different, and combining them assure that we just get the best cloaking ever.
  
  It's an extra step for us, but we know it means a lot to you, if your account can run longer and spend more.

- cutting edge cloaking method: We now have **reverse proxy**(  fully mirroring an exernal website to use it as safe page ), curl, and redirection ( and lately, it's actually works better than shopify on facebook! )

<br>

#### 2) More accurate tracking ðŸ”—

Tracking just got more accurate! Previously we tracked users client side using js, we realized that on some device we couldn't track up to 10% of your traffic. Now **we also track server side** for 100% accuracy ( same as other trackers but with the benefit of no redirection ). We won't miss any visits or click! 

<br><br>

#### 3) Even Easier ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›

We are always working on making blackflow easier to use.
