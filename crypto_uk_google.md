### Landers

**TIPS** from x

- what would be your strategy about it
  
  > Probably find some highly relevant pages to the ad. Then target only those pages setting 'Placements' to 'Target'. Start with CPM bidding then change to maximise clicks then change to CPA. Once it's as CPA enable 'Conservative' targeting and let Google learn outside of those placements. But I'm not sure this will work with Blackhat because it might need a lot of spend to get 50 conversions in crypto.

- how to lower cpc for campaign with small scale
  
  > You can find placements, even specific URLs, with low CPC and target only those with a 'Maximise Clicks' and set a max. CPC. Usually they'll be pages that are very relevant to your ad.

- do you see adwords or display working better for it?
  
  > Both are good but search is more expensive. Quality on search is better for me. On search you have to get a high QS which would mean your safe page needs to add value and be relevant. Search partners have a lot of potential so make sure they're enabled.

## Keywords

Target both exact and broad keyword. So you can get more traffic and optimize based on what people search for

"make money from home"
[make money online from home]
"make money online"
"how to make money"
"how to earn extra money"
"how to earn money from home"
"make extra money online from home"

#### Demo

Early on, you should remove the 18-25 age group

## Optimizing cost and conversion

#### Bid

usually you want to cap your max cpc, as google can get very expensive.

What we currently recommend for UK is setting max cpc at 0.5\$ and adjust the bid for desktop up to 1\$ as destkop convert 2-3x better than mobile.

#### Cost per conversion

After you set up pixel, you should see conversion appear on your adword account.
We fire these conv everytime we detect a click to offer with strong intent ( time >2min )

We call these lead, and they usually convert into Offer Lead ( signup  )

To recap : Lander lead ( good click ) -> Offer conv ( Signup) -> FTD ( deposit money )

You need to compare the cost per conv, with the stats we provide

You need to compare the cost per conv, with the general stats we provide

So it's seems above that my current cost per lead is too high 31$ > 26\$ but for mobile it's good, 4.5\$ < 12\$ ( 300% ROI )

What to do with these data? 

There are just early feedback, it's very early to conclude anything. Just use it as an indicator as if you are on the right track ( because sometime the way to the 700\$ FTD is long ). So don't take any harsh decision based on it.
