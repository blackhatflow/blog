### How to add offers





### Campaign scheduler?

Campaign scheduler auto start and auto pause campaign the time and day you choose.

It's useful because most of the offers have ON hours where you get most of the traffic and higher CR

Letting campaign live at night increase the risk of getting your campaign banned.

Think about it by scheduling your campaign between 8h - 20h local time you reduce risk by 50%

### How it works ?

The timezone is UTC so you need to adjust based on that.

- Ie you launch a campaign in USA from 8h to 20h local time GTM-4 , you need to convert schedule to 12:00 - 24:00
- Ie campaign in Germany from 8h to 20h local time GTM+1 , you need to convert schedule to 7:00 - 19:00

What else to know:

- The scheduler run every 30min, so don't set 9:15 as it will count as 9:30 anyway
- It will activate/pause only one time per day, so if the bot active the campaign at 8:00 and you pause it manually at 10:00, scheduler won't activate your campaign again for that day ( normal behavior )
- You need to tick the box schedule to make the bot active.
